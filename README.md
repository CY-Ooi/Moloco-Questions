# Moloco-Questions
Moloco data scientist interview questions

Both of the Analytics and Regression questions were solved using Python 3.

The Regression Question was solved with a polynomial regression model. The data point plot and a costs vs. iterations graph have been uploaded. Below is a summary of the results:
Theta computed from gradient descent = [21.52658284, 2.24467644, -83.57497779, -50.57083738, -74.83412351, 37.07234972, 20.635584, 65.88913992, -34.50928995, -96.7182869]
Mean squared error of the train set = 429085.43
Mean squared error of the test set = 23621.56

The results are not good since the model is simple. A higher degree of polynomial features may improve the results. Regularisation has been added to prevent over-fitting for the case of high degree polynomial.
